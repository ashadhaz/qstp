			<li>Chris Evans declined the role three times before accepting the part - not out of dislike for the role, but because he feared what the effects of the sudden increase of fame would be on his private life. Then Robert Downey Jr. convinced him to take the part and thus gain the freedom to sign on any other role he'd want to after. After that, he had a meeting with the director and the producers who convinced him to take the role.</li><br>
			<li>Originally cameo appearances were planned in the film for James "Logan" Howlett (Wolverine) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), who were present during World War II (Logan was a soldier and Lehnsherr was a prisoner of war). These cameos were scrapped due to rights issues.</li><br>
			<li>The Captain America comic book shown in the movies bears the cover of the actual Captain America #1 released in 1941.</li>

			<li>In the exhibition, there is a mannequin in a red jumpsuit under a glass dome. That is a reference to the android, the original Human Torch, the first superhero created by Timely Comics (October 1939), which eventually became Marvel Comics. He was also part of The Invaders along with Namor and Captain America. Marvel Comics recycled the name and abilities with the Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm (1961). Chris Evans portrayed Johnny Storm/Human Torch in the 'Fantastic Four' films.</li>
