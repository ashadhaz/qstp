			<p>From 1943 to 1945, Rogers had attacked multiple HYDRA bases alongside his own team, <br> the Howling Commandos, in an attempt to capture the Red Skull, and recover the Tesseract. <br>His famous World War II exploits had made him a living legend, and during this time he formed<br> a relationship with agent Peggy Carter. Despite seemingly losing his closest best friend and<br> loyal teammate, Bucky Barnes, during a mission, Rogers carried on to help the Allies win the<br> war, but crashed into the Arctic during his final mission. His close friend Howard Stark spent<br> time looking for his body. Rogers then spent nearly 70 years encased in ice in suspended<br> animation before he was found by S.H.I.E.L.D. in the early 21st century. <br><br><br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America">Click here</a> to go to the Wikipedia page of Captain America
